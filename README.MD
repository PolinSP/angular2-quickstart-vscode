This project contains the files necessary to run the Angular 2 Quick Start (TypeScript version) from within Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

These VS Code configuration files have been added to support TypeScript compilation and running the application:

 * .vscode/launch.json - configuration required to start the lite-server module used to host the application when run through VS Code
 * .vscode/tasks.json - configuration required to run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode to re-compile .ts files on save
